= Crispin

[quote, Terry Pratchett, Going Postal]
He pulled out a battered red journal and proffered it unsteadily. Gilt took it, and flicked it open.
His eye ran down the entries.
‘You wrote _everything_ down, Crispin?’ he said. ‘Why?’
Crispin looked appalled. ‘Got to keep records, Reacher,’ he said. ‘Can’t cover y’tracks if you
don’t know where y’left ‘em.

== Overview

Crispin is a library for managing project wide configuration.
An optimized version of this library for Dunaj can be found in `Dunaj` branch of this project.

Configuration map is assumed immutable and can be safely cached.
Configuration is static. When the config changes, service should be
restarted. Design choice is to have stateless fail-fast services,
that have their configuration stored on various places.

Main feature is to provides map merged from various sources, in following order:

* Configuration file in the root classpath
* Project specific environment variables
  (set e.g. in lein project.clj or profiles.clj)
  Users must use `lein-environ` plugin to enable this
* Environment variables, translating keys
* Java system properties, translating keys
* Custom configuration resources pointed from [:crispin]
  property, guessing format from filename, defaulting to .edn

All data is merged into one map and keys are translated to the
hierarchy of keywords. This will either be perfect to your project
or not useful at all.

Accepted file names for configuration files, loaded in following
order:

* config.json
* config.edn
* config.clj

Supports fetching external resources with #crispin.core/resorce "url" format.

Conflicts when merging branch and non-branch nodes are resolved
into creation of branch node with previous non-branch node put
under nil key.

Accepts map with types that parses values into desired format,
such as integer, keyword, vector, etc.

Available functions:

* cfg - does all the magic mentioned above and returns ordinary immutable map

Utility functions:

* sget
* bget
